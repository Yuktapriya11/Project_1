This project performs data analysis on student academic performance using the student-mat.csv dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It uses Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean and analyze the data, calculate key statistics (such as average final grades, correlation between study time and performance, and gender-based comparisons), and generate visualizations including histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts. The goal is to uncover insights into how different factors influence student success. The project is structured for easy use in Jupyter Notebook or Python script, making it a great example of beginner-friendly data science with real-world data.
